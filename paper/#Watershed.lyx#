Short Abstract
\change_deleted -190403614 1425519719
We present a method for hierarchical image segmentation that defines a disaffini
ty graph on the image, over-segments it into watershed basins, defines a
 new graph on the basins, and then merges basins with a modified, size-dependent
 version of single linkage clustering.
 The method is illustrated on the challenging problem of segmenting 3D electron
 microscopic brain images.
 Our watershed transform works by finding the basins of attraction of steepest
 descent dynamics, and has runtime that is linear in the number of graph
 edges.
 It yields basins similar to those of watershed cuts

(, except that plateaus are divided between basins consistently and in a
 more even way.
 In general, watershed algorithms tend to produce severe over-segmentation,
 which can be counteracted by pre- and/or post-processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\change_deleted -190403614 1425519719
Our post-processing starts by examining the new graph on the basins, in
 which the edge connecting two basins is assigned the same weight as the
 minimal edge connecting the basins in the original disaffinity graph.
 Then single linkage clustering yields a hierarchical segmentation of the
 original image in which the lowest level consists of the watershed basins.
 The levels of single linkage clustering yield flat segmentations in which
 some of the basins are merged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\change_deleted -190403614 1425519719
If we only expect to use levels above some minimum value T_min, then it
 turns out to be equivalent and more efficient to preprocess the original
 disaffinity graph before watershed by setting all edge weights below T_min
 to a common low value.
 In another pre-processing step we remove the edges with disaffinity to
 allow for unsegmented regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract

\change_deleted -190403614 1425519719
We also show how to modify single linkage clustering by making it depend
 not only on edge weights but also on cluster size - volume, length, etc.
 The modification is useful when there is prior knowledge about the size
 of true segments, and is shown to have an efficient implementation because
 size is a property that is guaranteed to increase with each agglomerative
 step.

Steepest descent graph.
 
\series default
The central quantity in the watershed algorithm is the steepest descent
 graph, defined as follows.
 Consider an undirected weighted graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 (Fig.
 1(a)).
 Define the directed graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G'$
\end_inset

 in which each undirected edge of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is replaced by both directed edges between the same vertices.
 The 
\emph on
steepest descent graph
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 (Fig.
 1(b)) is a subgraph of 
\begin_inset Formula $G'$
\end_inset

 with the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 includes every edge of 
\begin_inset Formula $G'$
\end_inset

 with minimal weight of all edges outgoing from the same vertex.
 A directed path in 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is a path of steepest descent in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, in the sense that every step is along an edge with locally minimal weight.
 The steepest ascent graph can be defined analogously using edges of maximal
 weight.
 Either steepest ascent or descent can be used without loss of generality.
 For simplicity, for a given vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 we will refer to its edges in 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 as incoming, outgoing, and bidirectional.
 A 
\emph on
plateau
\emph default
 is a connected component of the subgraph of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 containing only bidirectional edges.
 A 
\emph on

 is a vertex of a 
\emph on

\emph default
 that has at least one outgoing edge.

Locally minimal plateaus

Watershed transform algorithm.
 
\series default
We introduce an ordering function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha:V\to\{1,2,...,|V|\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(u)\neq\alpha(v)$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $u\neq v$

.
 We'll refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(u)$
\end_inset

 as the index of 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 (Fig.
 2(a)).
 In the first part of the algorithm we modify 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 by removing edges.
 For all 
\emph on
saddle vertices
\emph default
 we keep only one outgoing edge - the one pointing to a vertex with the
 lowest index.
 We then divide the 
\emph on
non-minimal plateaus
\emph default
.
 We initialize a global FIFO queue 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 We then mark all the 
\emph on
plateau corner
\emph default
 vertices as visited and insert them into 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 in increasing order of their index.
 While 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is not empty we remove the vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 from the top of the queue, we then follow all the bidirectional edges.
 If the vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 on the other side of the edge is not visited, we mark it as such, insert
 it to the back of the queue and change the edge to be incoming.
 Otherwise, if the vertex was already visited we just remove the edge.
 The resulting steepest descent graph is shown on Fig.
 2(c) - the dotted edges are removed.
 The connected components of the modified 
\emph on

 The total number of segments in the partitioning will equal to the total

Reducing over-segmentation.
 Often the edge weights of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 represent 
\emph on
disaffinities
\emph default
 - confidence that the two vertices don't belong to the same segment.
 The 
\emph on
disaffinity 
\emph default
between two vertices not connected by an edge is considered to be infinite.
 The 
\emph on
saliency 
\emph default
of two adjacent segments is the value of the minimal 
\emph on
disaffinity
\emph default
 between the vertices of the two segments.
 Noisy values of 
\emph on
disaffinities 
\emph default
can produce severe over-segmentation (Fig.
 3(c)).
 In order to reduce the over-segmentation we often merge adjacent segments
 with the 
\emph on
saliency 
\emph default
below some given threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\min}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We are confident 
\emph on
disaffinities 
\emph default
below 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\min}$
\end_inset

 should yield connected vertices.
 An equivalent segmentation can be obtained by replacing all edges in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 with the weight smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\min}$
\end_inset

 to a common low value (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

) before applying the watershed transform.
 We differ the proof to the supplementary material.
 To show confidence about high values of 
\emph on
disaffinities
\emph default
, and in order to prevent undesired mergers, we introduce a threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\max}$
\end_inset

 by erasing all the edges from 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 with the weight higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\max}$
\end_inset

, and essentially setting them to 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\max}$
\end_inset

 threshold can produce singleton vertices in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 The singleton vertices are not assigned to any 
\emph on
basin of attraction
\emph default
 and are considered background, which is often desired.

Hierarchical Clustering of the Watershed Basin Graph

\begin_layout Standard
A hierarchical clustering of an undirected weighted graph treats each vertex
 as a singleton cluster and successively merges clusters connected by an
 edge in the graph.
 A cluster is always a connected subset of the graph's vertices.
 Each merge operations creates a new level of the hierarchy - a flat segmentatio
n where each cluster represents a segment.
 In 
\emph on
single linkage
\emph default
 clustering, each step we merges two clusters connected by an edge with
 the lowest weight in the original graph.
 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Size-dependent comparison predicate.
 
\series default
We define a predicate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda,$
\end_inset

 for evaluating whether two clusters should be merged.
 The predicate is based on the sizes of the two clusters.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S(C)$
\end_inset

 represent the size of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 number of 
\emph on
basins
\emph default
 in the cluster or the sum of the 
\emph on
basin 
\emph default
sizes).
 The size can be any measure of a cluster with the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $S(C_{1}\cup C_{2})\ge S(C_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 We first define a non-increasing threshold function of cluster size 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(s)$
\end_inset

.
 For a given cluster size 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(s)$
\end_inset

 represents the maximal 
\emph on
saliency
\emph default
 allowed between a cluster of size 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and any adjacent cluster.
 Our predicate is then defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda(C_{1},C_{2})=\begin{cases}
\textrm{t\textrm{rue}} & \textrm{if }d_{C_{1},C_{2}}\ge\tau\left(\min\left\{ S(C_{1}),S(C_{2})\right\} \right)\\
\textrm{false} & \textrm{otherwise\textrm{ }}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intuition behind the predicate is to apply prior knowledge about the
 sizes of the true segments.
 With the threshold function we control the confidence required to grow
 a cluster of a certain size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a slight modification of the predicate we could allow for an arbitrary
 threshold function (changing the condition to 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{C_{1},C_{2}}\ge\min\left\{ \tau(S(C_{1})),\tau(S(C_{2}))\right\} )$
\end_inset

.
 However, restricting the function to be non-decreasing allows us to design
 a more efficient
\emph on
 
\emph default
algorithm.
 It is also more intuitive to allow higher 
\emph on
saliency
\emph default
 for merging small clusters and require lower 
\emph on
saliency
\emph default
 as the size of the clusters grow.

Theorem 1 
\series default
\emph on
The highest level of the hierarchical segmentation produced by algorithm
 (1) will have the predicate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 satisfied for all pairs of the clusters.
 The complexity of the algorithm is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|E_{W}\right|\log\left|E_{W}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 The algorithm can be modified to consider only the edges of the minimum
 cost spanning tree of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{W}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defer the proof the supplementary material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The steps 2-5 of the algorithm have near linear complexity.
 Once we have a sorted list of the edges we can re-run the algorithm for
 different threshold functions more efficiently.

Metric
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good metric for evaluating a segmentation should ideally tell us how good
 the segmentation is for using in practice.
 Mainly how much manual corrections are needed to acheve the correct segmentatio
n.
 Often foreground-restricted Rand Index

\end_inset

 between the proposed segmentation and the ground truth is used.
 However it has problems when the number of segments is large as the dynamics
 range gets smaller.
 A better method is proposed by Arganda et al in preparation that better
 estimastes the amount of user reaction needed to correct the segmentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can produce great over-segmentation.
 Final segmentation can be obtained by merging our segments.
 It would be a good input to a lot of other methods like
