abstract = {We study the watersheds in edge-weighted graphs. We define the watershed cuts following the intuitive idea of drops of water flowing on a topographic surface. We first establish the consistency of these watersheds: They can be equivalently defined by their "catchment basins" (through a steepest descent property) or by the "dividing lines" separating these catchment basins (through the drop of water principle). Then, we prove, through an equivalence theorem, their optimality in terms of minimum spanning forests. Afterward, we introduce a linear-time algorithm to compute them. To the best of our knowledge, similar properties are not verified in other frameworks and the proposed algorithm is the most efficient existing algorithm, both in theory and in practice. Finally, the defined concepts are illustrated in image segmentation, leading to the conclusion that the proposed approach improves, on the tested images, the quality of watershed-based segmentations.},

Known algorithms for finding the MST are discussed. They are efficient even when there are very many points; this makes a SLCA practicable when other methods of cluster analysis are not. The relevant computing procedures are published in the Algorithm section of the same issue of Applied Statistics. The use of the MST in the interpretation of vector diagrams arising in multivariate analysis is illustrated by an example. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1969 Royal Statistical Society},

abstract = {In this work, we extend a common framework for graph-based image segmentation that includes the graph cuts, random walker, and shortest path optimization algorithms. Viewing an image as a weighted graph, these algorithms can be expressed by means of a common energy function with differing choices of a parameter q acting as an exponent on the differences between neighboring nodes. Introducing a new parameter p that fixes a power for the edge weights allows us to also include the optimal spanning forest algorithm for watershed in this same framework. We then propose a new family of segmentation algorithms that fixes p to produce an optimal spanning forest but varies the power q beyond the usual watershed algorithm, which we term the power watershed. In particular, when q=2, the power watershed leads to a multilabel, scale and contrast invariant, unique global optimum obtained in practice in quasi-linear time. Placing the watershed algorithm in this energy minimization framework also opens new possibilities for using unary terms in traditional watershed segmentation and using watershed to optimize more general models of use in applications beyond image segmentation.},

In this paper, our main contribution is a thinning paradigm from which we derive three algorithmic watershed cut strategies: The first one is well suited to parallel implementations, the second one leads to a flexible linear-time sequential implementation, whereas the third one links the watershed cuts and the popular flooding algorithms. We state that watershed cuts preserve a notion of contrast, called connection value, on which several morphological region merging methods are (implicitly) based. We also establish the links and differences between watershed cuts, minimum spanning forests, shortest path forests, and topological watersheds. Finally, we present illustrations of the proposed framework to the segmentation of artwork surfaces and diffusion tensor images.},
