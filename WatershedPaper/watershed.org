* relation to previous work
** watershed on graphs previously done in watershed cuts paper
*** definition
**** plateau division
*** algorithm
**** one pass: alternating depth first search and breadth first search
***** start depth first search
***** switch to breadth first search at plateau
***** switch back to depth first search at plateau corner
***** repeat
***** effectively online computation of steepest descent graph 
**** split search process into several passes
***** steepest descent graph
***** identify saddle vertices and plateau corners
***** divide plateaus via breadth first search
***** connected components
*** time complexity
**** both are linear
*** advantages of multiple passes
**** possible to divide plateaus evenly
**** separate computation into parallelizable vs. serial part
first two passes are readily parallelizable
